# Premium Features

Premium unlocks additional Bet2Invest features for both **bettors** and **tipsters**. It focuses on three things:

* Better **information** (more data, full predictions in notifications)
* Better **control** (multiple bankrolls, custom embeds, extra profile links)
* Better **experience** (unlimited alerts for all experts, no ads, lower auto‑betting fees)

Premium is available on a **monthly** or **yearly** subscription. Exact prices and promotions are displayed directly on the Bet2Invest pricing page.

### What you get as a bettor

As a bettor following experts, Premium gives you:

* **Premium badge on your profile**\
  A visual badge that shows other users you are a Premium member.
* **Unlimited tipsters notifications**\
  No limit on how many email / Telegram alerts you can receive when experts you follow publish new tips.\
  Without Premium, notifications for **PRO Experts are already unlimited**, but notifications from **other experts** are limited (see [how do I receive the tips?](../follow-experts/how-do-i-receive-the-tips.md)).
* **Full prediction in notifications**\
  Your notifications can include the **complete pick details** (event, market, odds, stake…), so you don’t need to open the site every time.
* **Export statistics to CSV**\
  Download your data (bankroll history, expert stats, etc.) to analyse it in Excel, Google Sheets, or your own tools.
* **No ads on the platform**\
  Enjoy a cleaner interface without advertising when browsing Bet2Invest.
* **Reduced auto‑betting fees (0.2%)**\
  If you use auto‑betting, your commission is reduced, making it cheaper to execute tips automatically over the long run.

{% hint style="success" %}
Premium is automatically included when you subscribe to **B2I One** plans, so you don’t need a separate Premium subscription in that case. See [Easiest way to Follow Experts](../follow-experts/easiest-way-to-follow-experts.md).
{% endhint %}

### What you get as a tipster / Expert

As a tipster (Expert), Premium helps you manage and promote your strategies more professionally:

* **Premium badge on your profile**\
  Highlights your account as Premium, which can help with credibility when users discover your profile.
* **Multiple bankroll management**\
  Create and manage **more than the default bankrolls**, so you can separate strategies (by league, model, risk level, etc.). See [What's a Bankroll?](../bankrolls/whats-a-bankroll.md).
* **Margin visible at the moment of the tip**\
  See the bookmaker **margin** directly when you publish a pick, helping you target sharper markets and understand how much edge is required.
* **Custom embed codes**\
  Generate embed codes to display your bankroll or results on external sites (blogs, personal websites, social media pages), while keeping all stats certified on Bet2Invest.
* **Additional links in your tipster profile**\
  Add extra external links (website, social profiles, communities, etc.) to your Expert profile.

These benefits make it easier to:

* Run several strategies in parallel.
* Communicate your value to followers.
* Optimise your markets and margin targeting.

### Is Premium mandatory?

No. You can use Bet2Invest for free, discover experts, and learn how to analyse performance without Premium.

Notifications for **all PRO Experts** you follow are already **unlimited**, even on the free plan. Premium simply extends unlimited notifications to **every expert** you follow and unlocks **extra comfort and power features**. It is especially useful if you:

* Follow several experts and want **unlimited notifications for all of them**, plus CSV exports.
* Want a **clean, ad‑free** platform.
* Manage multiple bankrolls or run several strategies as a tipster.
* Use **auto‑betting** regularly and benefit from the reduced fee.

You can upgrade or cancel your Premium subscription at any time from your account settings on Bet2Invest.
