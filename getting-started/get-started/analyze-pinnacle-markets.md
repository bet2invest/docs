# Analyze Pinnacle Markets

Bet2Invest is not only a platform to follow Experts — it can also be used as a **market analysis tool**.

One of the most powerful use cases is analysing **Pinnacle markets**, because Pinnacle is widely considered the sharpest and most efficient pricing reference in sports betting.

{% hint style="info" %}
Bet2Invest is one of the very few platforms offering a **true, real‑time (non‑delayed) Pinnacle API** experience for market analysis. Most of the core analysis features described below are **free**.
{% endhint %}

***

### Explore Pinnacle like a bookmaker interface

On Bet2Invest, you get an interface similar to bookmakers where you can browse:

* Every **sport**
* Every **league / competition**
* Every **matchup**
* Every **market type**

This is designed to let you analyse the market the same way you would **place a bet**, but with extra analytical layers that are usually not available on bookmaker websites.

***

### What you can analyse on each market

For each market price, Bet2Invest lets you see key data points such as:

* **Current odds**
* **Opening odds**
* **Odds evolution** (movement over time)
* **Bookmaker margin**
* **Implied probabilities**

In addition, you can compare the market to what the community is thinking using the:

* **B2I tips distribution** – an aggregated view of what tipsters on Bet2Invest are picking on that market.

{% hint style="success" %}
This combination (sharp odds + line movement + margin + implied probabilities + tipster distribution) is what allows you to think in terms of **pricing** and **expected value**, not just “teams” and “predictions”.
{% endhint %}

### Turn market analysis into a tracked strategy (by placing bets)

Market analysis becomes much more valuable when you can **measure your decisions over time**.

On Bet2Invest, you can simulate real betting conditions by placing bets inside a:

* **Public bankroll** (visible to others), or
* **Private bankroll** (visible only to you)

See [What's a Bankroll?](../../bankrolls/whats-a-bankroll.md).

Once you place a bet in a bankroll, you can access advanced metrics such as:

* **Closing odds**
* **CLV** (Closing Line Value)
* **CLEV** (CLV without the bookmaker margin)
* **Market margin** at bet time vs at close
* **Automatic settling** using real Pinnacle grading rules

To understand why CLV/CLEV are central metrics on Bet2Invest, see [Why CLV & CLEV Matter](../../bankrolls/why-clv-and-clev-matter.md).

***

### Build strategies from Pinnacle data

With all this market history and performance data, you can create strategies based on:

* **Line movement patterns**
* **Market types** (main lines vs derivatives)
* **Margins** (where the bookmaker edge is highest/lowest)
* **Timing** (opening vs mid‑week vs close vs live)
* **Your own long‑term CLV/CLEV**

This is the foundation of a data‑driven approach: you are not only asking “did I win?”, but also “did I beat the market consistently?”.

To learn how to read performance properly, see [How to Analyse Bankrolls?](/broken/spaces/5n72pwOaMHfHUcwKj6uG/pages/i49LrUfWAbvDG4moIwctn).

### Markets available on Bet2Invest

Bet2Invest is built to analyse **all Pinnacle markets**, not only the most common ones.

You can analyse, among others:

* **Prematch** markets
* **Live** markets
* **Futures**
* **Corners**
* **Bookings / cards**

…and many more. In practice, every market available on Pinnacle is intended to be available on Bet2Invest.

***

### Odds integrity: you can’t “fake” prices

A key part of market analysis is knowing the odds history is trustworthy.

On Bet2Invest, odds are **verified at the moment you place a bet** using Pinnacle’s data, which prevents users from manually entering unrealistic prices.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If market odds could be edited, performance metrics would become meaningless. Bet2Invest prevents this by certifying odds at bet time.
{% endhint %}

### Next step

If you want to go deeper, start by creating a private bankroll and tracking a simple, consistent approach with fixed stakes (units).
