# Become a PRO Expert

On Bet2Invest, we value transparency, strict bankroll management and data-driven models. Not hype.\
To learn more about what truly matters to us, please read [Our Vision](../vision.md).

Becoming an Expert on Bet2Invest is not easy and will require statistical and mathematical knowledge. It takes time to develop a good track record, so be patient and disciplined.

***

On Bet2Invest, **EVERYONE** can post predictions using a user-friendly interface, similar to bookmakers.

You'll need **at least** 400 predictions and 4% yield to be eligible to the "PRO" Status.

To understand the detailed eligibility rules, see [Requirements](../../experts/pro-requirements.md).

## Step-By-Step Guide

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Build or use a strict Strategy

Before thinking about selling your picks, you need a **clear, repeatable strategy** that can be tracked inside a [bankroll](../../bankrolls/whats-a-bankroll.md).

Your strategy should:

* Use a **fixed unit size** for almost all bets (see [What's a Unit?](../../bankrolls/whats-a-unit.md)).
* Focus on **specific markets** where you believe you have an edge (league, sport, market type…).
* Respect **liquidity constraints** so that followers can realistically copy your odds.
* Be based on **data and logic**, not on feelings or "locks".

You can start by testing privately with your **Private Bankroll**, then go public once you are comfortable with your rules.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Be Consistent

To reach PRO status, you need **volume and stability over time**.

* Aim for **20–30 bets per month at minimum**, for several consecutive months.
* Avoid changing your staking, sports, or markets every week.
* Let your bankroll grow to **400+ tracked bets** so that your yield and CLV/CLEV become meaningful (see [How to Analyse Bankrolls?](../../follow-experts/how-to-analyse-bankrolls.md)).
* Accept variance: even strong strategies can be negative for weeks. What matters is the **long-term curve**.

Bet2Invest looks for experts who show **discipline, repeatability, and respect for risk management**, not just a lucky short-term run.
{% endstep %}

### Get paid by your subscribers

Once you reach the required track record (currently **400+ bets and 4%+ yield**) and pass manual checks, you can be granted the **PRO Expert** status.

As a PRO Expert, you can earn money in three ways:

* **Individual subscriptions** – users pay to follow you directly, and you receive **67% of the subscription price**.
* **Picks by Package** – sometimes users purchase picks in packages. You will be paid for the tips you've provided at the same time as the subscriptions are processed, which is on the 5th of each month.&#x20;
* **B2I One** – if you are selected in B2I One plans, you earn a share of that group subscription alongside other experts.

Bet2Invest keeps the remaining share. The goal is to reward PRO Experts fairly while maintaining a sustainable ecosystem for followers.

A dedicated page in the **Experts** section details exactly **how PRO Experts get paid** across individual subscriptions, packages, and B2I One.
