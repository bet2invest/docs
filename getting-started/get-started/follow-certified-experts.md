# Follow Certified Experts

## Follow Certified Experts

Bet2Invest allows you to follow **certified Experts (PRO Experts)** whose strategies have been vetted using strict internal criteria.

There are **two main ways** to follow them:

1. Via curated **packages** with **B2I One** (simplest, diversified)
2. **Individually**, by choosing specific Experts you like

This page explains how both options work and how to decide which one is best for you.

For context on what makes a good Expert and how to read their stats, see:

* [What's an expert?](../../experts/whats-an-expert.md)
* [Rating System](../../experts/rating-system.md)
* [How to Analyse Bankrolls?](../../follow-experts/how-to-analyse-bankrolls.md)

***

### Option 1 – Follow Experts by package (B2I One)

The easiest and safest way to start is to use **B2I One**, which is a curated package of top PRO Experts selected by Bet2Invest.

#### What is B2I One?

B2I One is an **all‑in‑one subscription** that gives you:

* Access to a **group of certified Experts** selected by Bet2Invest.
* **Automatic diversification** across several bankrolls and strategies.
* **Premium** included in the price (no need to buy it separately).

You simply choose a B2I One plan (Beginner, Investor, Whale, etc.) and Bet2Invest handles the expert selection for you. See [Easiest way to Follow Experts](../../follow-experts/easiest-way-to-follow-experts.md) for full details.

#### How to subscribe to a B2I One package

1. Go to the **B2I One** section on Bet2Invest.\

2. Compare the available plans (e.g. Beginner, Investor, Whale) in terms of:
   * Number of Experts
   * Ideal user profile (beginner, advanced, higher stakes…)
   * Variance / risk level
3. Click **Get** (or the equivalent button) on the plan you want.\

4. Confirm the subscription.

Once subscribed, you automatically follow **all Experts** inside that package.

#### When and where you receive tips

Each time a B2I One Expert publishes a tip:

* It appears in your Bet2Invest interface under your followed Experts.
* You receive a **notification** (Telegram or email) according to your settings. See [how do I receive the tips?](../../follow-experts/how-do-i-receive-the-tips.md).

Because B2I One uses **PRO Experts only**, **notifications for these Experts are always unlimited**, even if you don’t have Premium.

### Option 2 – Follow Certified Experts individually

If you prefer more control, you can pick and follow **individual certified Experts** instead of (or in addition to) B2I One.

#### How to find certified Experts

1. Open the **Experts / Tipsters** section on Bet2Invest.\
   &#xNAN;_&#x69;nsert a screenshot_
2. Use filters or sorting to focus on:
   * **Certified / PRO** status
   * **Rating** (0–5 scale)
   * Sport, league, odds range, liquidity, etc.
3. Click on an Expert to open their **profile and bankrolls**.\
   &#xNAN;_&#x69;nsert a screenshot_

On the profile, you can review:

* Overall **rating**
* Key metrics (yield, number of bets, CLV/CLEV, liquidity…)
* Bankroll history and drawdowns

Use the guidance in [How to Analyse Bankrolls?](../../follow-experts/how-to-analyse-bankrolls.md) if you are unsure how to interpret these stats.

#### How to follow an Expert individually

When you are on a certified Expert’s profile:

1. Click the **Follow** / **Subscribe** button.\
   &#xNAN;_&#x69;nsert a screenshot_
2. Choose the **subscription type** if there are several options (for example, specific bankroll vs full access).
3. Confirm the subscription.

After that, every new tip published by this Expert will be sent to you as a notification and will appear in your followed tips list.

#### Notifications and limits

* When you follow **PRO Experts**, notifications are **always unlimited**, even on the free plan.
* Following non‑PRO experts may be subject to limits unless you have Premium. For full details, see [how do I receive the tips?](../../follow-experts/how-do-i-receive-the-tips.md) and [Premium Features](../premium-features.md).

### Which option should you choose?

**Use B2I One packages if you:**

* Prefer a **hands‑off** approach with Bet2Invest doing the expert selection.
* Want **built‑in diversification** across several PRO Experts.
* Are new to analysing bankrolls or don’t want to spend time choosing individuals.

**Follow individual Experts if you:**

* Enjoy analysing stats and choosing your own strategies.
* Want to build a **custom mix** of Experts (sports, leagues, variance levels).
* Already understand metrics like yield, CLV/CLEV, and liquidity.

You can also **combine both approaches**: use a B2I One plan as your core and add a few individual Experts on top.

Whatever you choose, always:

* Set a proper [bankroll](../../bankrolls/whats-a-bankroll.md).
* Use consistent [units](../../bankrolls/whats-a-unit.md).
* Accept [variance](../../bankrolls/whats-variance.md) as part of the journey.
