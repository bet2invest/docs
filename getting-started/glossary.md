# Glossary

This glossary centralises the most important concepts used across Bet2Invest. Use it as a quick reference when you read the rest of the documentation.

For a high‑level introduction, see:

* [Welcome](../)
* [Get Started](get-started/)

***

### A

**Auto‑betting**\
An optional feature that automatically executes experts’ tips on Pinnacle on your behalf, so you don’t need to place each bet manually. See [What is Auto‑betting?](../auto-betting/what-is-auto-betting.md).

**Average Odds**\
The average price (odds) of all bets in a bankroll. Higher average odds usually mean higher variance (bigger swings), while lower odds typically mean smoother but harder‑to‑beat markets.

***

### B

**Bankroll**\
The dedicated pool of money you use exclusively for betting. On Bet2Invest, every strategy is tracked inside a bankroll so results, drawdowns, and risk are clear. See [What's a Bankroll?](../bankrolls/whats-a-bankroll.md).

**B2I One**\
A curated, all‑in‑one package where Bet2Invest selects a group of top Experts for you, bundled with Premium features. Designed as the easiest way to follow multiple experts. See [Easiest way to Follow Experts](../follow-experts/easiest-way-to-follow-experts.md).

***

### C

**PRO Expert (or PRO Tipster)**\
An Expert who has reached Bet2Invest’s internal requirements (track record, yield, discipline, etc.) and has been manually verified. PRO Experts can sell access to their tips and be included in curated offers such as B2I One. See [Requirements](../experts/pro-requirements.md) and [Become a PRO Expert](get-started/become-a-pro-expert.md).

**CLV (Closing Line Value)**\
A metric comparing the odds you took to the final market odds at closing. Positive CLV means you consistently beat the closing price, a strong sign of edge.

**CLEV**\
A version of CLV that removes the bookmaker margin, focusing purely on market efficiency. Positive CLEV is one of the strongest indicators that an Expert truly beats the market, not just the bookmaker’s margin.

***

### E

**Expert (Tipster)**\
Someone who shares a structured, data‑driven betting strategy through one or more public bankrolls so that others can follow it. On Bet2Invest, “Expert”, “tipster”, and “capper” refer to the same role. See [What's an expert?](../experts/whats-an-expert.md).

***

### L

**Liquidity (AMB)**\
A measure of how much money can be staked on a market without moving the odds too much. On Bet2Invest, this is captured by AMB (Average Maximum Bet). High liquidity means more followers can realistically copy an Expert’s bets. See [Best practices](../bankrolls/best-practices.md).

***

### P

**Premium**\
A paid plan on Bet2Invest that unlocks additional features such as more bankrolls, advanced analytics, unlimited notifications, and more. It is automatically included in B2I One plans. See [Premium Features](premium-features.md).

**Private Bankroll**\
A bankroll visible only to you, ideal for testing strategies or experimenting before going public. See [What's a Bankroll?](../bankrolls/whats-a-bankroll.md).

**Public Bankroll**\
A bankroll visible to others, used to share your performance and strategies publicly and, for Experts, to build the track record needed for PRO status. See [What's a Bankroll?](../bankrolls/whats-a-bankroll.md).

***

### R

**Rating (Expert Rating)**\
A single grade from 0 to 5 that summarises the overall quality and reliability of an Expert, based on yield, odds, liquidity, CLV/CLEV, stake consistency, and more. First available at 200 tips. Experts are sorted by this rating by default. See [Rating System](../experts/rating-system.md).

***

### U

**Unit**\
A standardised way to express bet size as a percentage of your bankroll (often 1% by default). Using units instead of currency makes results comparable between different bankroll sizes and avoids emotional stake changes. See [What's a Unit?](../bankrolls/whats-a-unit.md).

**Units Variance**\
How much an Expert’s stake size (in units) changes from one bet to another. Lower variance (flat stakes) is considered safer and more reliable for followers and is rewarded by the rating system.

***

### V

**Variance**\
The natural ups and downs in results, even for profitable strategies. Higher odds and lower liquidity usually mean higher variance (bigger swings). Understanding variance is essential to avoid over‑reacting to short‑term losing streaks. See [What's Variance?](../bankrolls/whats-variance.md).

***

### Y

**Yield**\
A measure of long‑term profitability expressed as a percentage: profit (in units) divided by total staked units. Positive yield over a large number of bets indicates edge, especially when supported by positive CLV/CLEV and good liquidity.
