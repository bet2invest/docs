# What's a Bankroll?

A bankroll is the amount of money you dedicate exclusively to betting. **It exists to protect you from emotional decisions, manage risk, and allow your strategy to survive natural variance**. A good bankroll isolates your betting activity from your personal finances and helps you measure real performance over time.

Bet2Invest uses bankrolls to help you test, track, and compare strategies with professional-level discipline.

A bankroll is not your savings. It is a dedicated pool of money used to follow strategies, absorb losing streaks, and evaluate long-term results.
{% endhint %}

Managing a bankroll properly means using consistent stakes, avoiding random changes in bet size, and treating your betting activity like an investment. On Bet2Invest, this is done through the unit system: 1 unit always represents the same proportion of your bankroll, regardless of the currency you use.

### Bankrolls on Bet2Invest

By default, every user has **two bankrolls**:

{% columns %}
{% column %}
{% hint style="success" %}
**Public Bankroll**\
Visible to others. Useful for sharing your performance, ideas, and strategies publicly.
{% endhint %}


{% endcolumn %}

{% column %}
{% hint style="warning" %}
**Private Bankroll**\
Visible only to you. Ideal for personal testing, experiments, or strategies you don’t want to reveal.
{% endhint %}


{% endcolumn %}
{% endcolumns %}

Premium users can also **create additional bankrolls**, each with its own visibility settings. This allows you to separate strategies, compare approaches, or run multiple simulations at once.

Bankroll creation beyond the default two is a Premium feature.
