# Unit Increments & Limits

Bet2Invest uses **units** to keep staking consistent and performance comparable across bankrolls and users.

This page explains the **default unit increments** available when publishing tips, and how to request additional staking options for specific strategies.

***

### Default unit increments

By default, unit sizes are limited to **increments of 0.25U**, from **0.25U up to 10U**:

* `0.25`, `0.5`, `0.75`, `1`, `1.25`, … up to `10`

This means you can publish stakes such as:

* `1U`
* `1.5U`
* `2.75U`
* `10U`

…but you cannot select arbitrary values like `0.33U` or `1.1U` unless special access is enabled for your account.

### Why Bet2Invest limits unit sizes

Unit increments are limited by default to:

* encourage **disciplined staking**
* reduce accidental input errors
* keep bankroll statistics easier to interpret and compare

Bet2Invest may also **restrict** the available unit sizes for a given user if needed (for example, to prevent staking behavior that could be **dangerous to followers**).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Excessively varying stake sizes can make a track record less reliable and may negatively impact how a bankroll is perceived.
{% endhint %}

### Need other unit sizes? (request unlock)

If you have a **specific strategy** that requires different increments (for example: a model-driven staking plan), you can contact us and request additional unit sizes.

When you contact us, include:

* which bankroll/strategy it’s for
* why 0.25 increments are not sufficient
* which unit values/increments you want enabled (example: `0.1U` steps, or specific fixed sizes)

If it fits the strategy and quality criteria, we can **unlock other units** for your account.

This is handled case-by-case to protect tracking integrity while still supporting advanced strategies.
