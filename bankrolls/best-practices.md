# Best practices

**Managing bankrolls correctly is one of the most important skills in betting**. A healthy bankroll protects you from emotional decisions, keeps your stakes consistent, and allows you to evaluate strategies objectively.\
This page outlines the best practices to follow when using bankrolls on Bet2Invest.

These good practices apply to you even if you are just following [Experts](../experts/whats-an-expert.md) or actually trying to build a strategy.

## 1. Treat your Bankroll Like an Investment

Your bankroll is not for experimenting recklessly or chasing losses. It should be handled with the same seriousness as an investment portfolio.

{% hint style="info" %}
Every bankroll represents a strategy. Protect it, track it, and maintain stable rules.
{% endhint %}

Avoid mixing personal money with bankroll money. This prevents emotional decisions and makes your performance trackable.

## 2. Use Units Consistently

The core rule of bankroll management is consistency. On Bet2Invest, each bet is expressed in units, not currency. **Most of the time, 1 unit is 1% of your bankroll.**

**In 99% of the cases, you should use 1 unit for each bet, independently of  your "trust".**

{% hint style="danger" %}
Never increase your unit size because you “feel confident” about a pick. Confidence is not an edge. This will lead to poor bankroll management, and Bet2Invest will refrain from recommending you.
{% endhint %}

## 3. Understand Variance and Loosing Streaks

All profitable strategies include downturns. Losing streaks are normal.

{% hint style="success" %}
A good strategy is not one that avoids losses. It is one that survives them and recovers over time.
{% endhint %}

Do not shrink or increase your unit size in reaction to short-term outcomes. Stick to your plan.

## 4. Judge a strategy only after sufficient volume

A bankroll with only 20 or 50 bets tells you nothing. Real evaluation happens over **hundreds or thousands of bets**.

Betting is a long-term activity. A bankroll needs time to reveal its true edge.

Instead of asking “Is this strategy good?” after 30 bets, ask:\
• Is the staking consistent?\
• Is the CLV/CLEV positive over a decent sample?\
• Is the ROI stable when it reaches 300, 500 or 1000 bets?

## 5. Use Sharp Operators, Not Recreational Ones

We're not here to help you find the best bookmaker, but using the right one is a **fundamental best practice;** especially before following experts, building strategies, or interpreting your bankroll results.

Most bettors lose money simply because they bet with operators that make winning mathematically impossible.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you use a bookmaker with high margins, your strategy can be profitable on paper but unprofitable in reality.
{% endhint %}

{% columns %}
{% column %}
**Sharp Operators**

• Low margins\
• High liquidity\
• Don’t limit winning players\
• Provide true market prices\
• Ideal for long-term strategies
{% endcolumn %}

{% column %}
**Recreational Operators**

• Very high margins\
• Boosts and traps to attract losing bettors\
• Fast and permanent account limitations\
• Unstable or delayed odds\
• Impossible to scale a profitable strategy
{% endcolumn %}
{% endcolumns %}

Bet2Invest relies on Pinnacle for certified odds, market data, and automated betting features.

Pinnacle, in our view, is the **most efficient and reliable pricing source in the betting industry**, and this makes it the only realistic foundation for a transparent, data-driven platform like Bet2Invest.

## 6. The Liquidity Really Matters

Liquidity is one of the **most underestimated** factors in betting, yet it affects _everything_: the odds you can take, the volume you can stake, the accuracy of your performance, and even whether a strategy is realistically followable.

On Bet2Invest, liquidity is captured through _AMB_ (Average Maximum Bet), which shows how much a market can absorb without crashing the price.

{% columns %}
{% column %}
**For Followers**

High liquidity means you can copy a tipster’s bets without losing value.

\
Low liquidity means the price collapses before you can even place the bet.
{% endcolumn %}

{% column %}
**For Experts (Tipsters)**

A strategy is only truly scalable if many followers can take the same odds.

\
Small markets = low follower capacity and inflated ROI that cannot be replicated.
{% endcolumn %}
{% endcolumns %}

### Quick Comparison

| Market Type                                  | Liquidity | Expert Impact                                         | Follow Experience                                          |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Top Leagues (Premier League, NBA, NFL, etc.) | Very High | Hard to have a huge ROI, operator really confident    | Really easy to follow, no odds drops                       |
| Medium Leagues                               | Medium    | Edge is somewhat scalable, with slightly high margins | Small slippage possible                                    |
| Niche Leagues / Player Props, etc.           | Low       | ROI looks great but fragile, really high margins      | Hard to follow with the same prices, but often better ROIs |

## Final Advice

Betting success depends far more on discipline and structure than on individual picks.

Your bankroll is the foundation of your betting journey. Treat it professionally and your performance will reflect it.
