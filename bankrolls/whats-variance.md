# What's Variance?

Variance is the **natural randomness in short-term results**. In sports betting – especially sharp betting on efficient markets – variance is what makes a **good strategy look bad for a while**, or a bad strategy look good.

You can have a real edge, follow a solid model, beat the closing line, and **still lose for weeks**. That’s not necessarily a problem with your strategy; it’s often just variance.

***

### Variance in sports betting

In sharp betting, you usually bet into **efficient markets** with a **small but real edge** - often just a few percentage points.

This combination creates:

* **High volatility in the short term**: long winning or losing streaks are normal.
* **Slow realization of your edge**: it can take hundreds or thousands of bets for your true skill to show in results.
* **Emotionally hard periods**: you can do everything "right" and still lose money for a while.

{% hint style="info" %}
Variance is not your enemy - it is simply the price you pay for betting in uncertain environments.\
Your job is not to eliminate variance, but to **survive it** with proper bankroll and staking.
{% endhint %}

### Variance vs. being wrong

Losing streaks happen to everyone. The key is to **separate variance from bad strategy**:

* **Variance**
  * You follow a disciplined process.
  * You consistently beat the closing line or get good prices.
  * Results swing up and down, sometimes painfully.
  * Over a large sample, performance stabilises.
* **Being wrong**
  * You take random bets, follow emotions, or chase losses.
  * You do not get good odds on average compared to closing lines.
  * Performance stays poor over time, not just in the short term.

Sharp betting accepts that **short-term results lie**, and focuses on long-term edges.

***

### How variance shows up in your bankroll

Variance is what makes your bankroll graph move **up and down in waves**, even if your strategy is profitable.

Common symptoms of variance:

* Long losing streaks (10+ bets lost in a row is completely normal at common odds).
* Big drawdowns where your bankroll drops 5%, 10% or more.
* Periods where you have really good streaks - followed by periods where nothing goes your way.

This is why Bet2Invest is built around:

* **Bankrolls** – a dedicated pool of money to absorb these swings.
* **Units** – a fixed fraction of your bankroll per bet to keep risk under control.

If your unit size is too large, normal variance can **wipe out your bankroll** before your edge has time to appear.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Many bettors quit _right before_ their results start reflecting their skill.\
They either over-stake (units too big) or give up after a natural negative run.
{% endhint %}

### Why variance is higher in sharp environments

In recreational markets, prices can be very wrong, and some bettors win simply because the odds are soft. In sharp markets:

* Edges are **small but real** (for example, +2% to +5% expected ROI).
* The house and other sharp bettors are also extremely skilled.
* The line is hard to beat, so most of your advantage is **tiny and long term**.

With small edges:

* Short-term results are dominated by luck.
* Even a strong bettor can look break-even or losing for hundreds of bets.
* Only **large samples** reveal the difference between a sharp bettor and a random one.

***

### Practical mindset for dealing with variance

* Expect losing runs – plan for them before they happen.
* Focus on the **quality of your bets** (prices, markets, methodology), not just outcomes.
* Use your bankroll and unit system as rules, not suggestions.
* Track results, but do not overreact to short-term swings.

Handled correctly, variance becomes **manageable noise** around a profitable strategy rather than a reason to panic or abandon sharp betting.
