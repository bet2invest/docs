# Easiest way to Follow Experts

Following experts can be difficult when you're faced with dozens of bankrolls, dozens of metrics, and a lot of uncertainty.

That’s why Bet2Invest created **B2I One** - the simplest and safest way to follow high-quality experts without having to choose them yourself.

B2I One is an **all-in-one curated package** where Bet2Invest selects a group of top-performing, reliable, and scalable experts for you, based on strict internal criteria (liquidity, CLV/CLEV, long-term ROI, variance, and consistency).

It also automatically includes **Premium**, so you get the complete experience in one subscription.

The more you follow certified Experts, the more you reduce your [Variance Risk](../bankrolls/whats-variance.md); when one expert is having a bad run, there is a good chance the other ones are not.
