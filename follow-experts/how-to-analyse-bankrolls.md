# How to Analyse Bankrolls?

Analyzing bankrolls properly is essential before following an [Expert](../experts/whats-an-expert.md). A [Bankroll](../bankrolls/whats-a-bankroll.md) shows the **true long-term performance** of a strategy: whether it is sustainable, scalable, and realistically followable.

Bet2Invest provides certified data, liquidity metrics, and advanced statistics to help you evaluate experts with clarity and confidence.

#### What Makes a Bankroll really Reliable?

Below is a non-exhaustive list of reliability criteria:

<table><thead><tr><th width="176.2421875">Factor</th><th width="175.35546875">What It Measures</th><th>Why It Matters</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Number of Bets</td><td>Sample size</td><td>A bankroll needs ~400+ bets to reduce variance and reveal true performance. More = better.</td></tr><tr><td>Yield</td><td>Profitability</td><td>Core indicator of long-term edge. Must be positive and stable over large samples.</td></tr><tr><td>Liquidity (AMB)</td><td>Market depth</td><td>High liquidity means followers can reproduce odds. Low liquidity = hard strategy to follow.</td></tr><tr><td>Unit Consistency</td><td>Stake reliability</td><td>Using fixed units (1U, 2U, 3U max) avoids manipulation and keeps stats clean and comparable.</td></tr><tr><td>CLV / CLEV</td><td>Market efficiency</td><td>Positive CLEV is extremely strong: it proves the expert beats the market AND the bookmaker margin.</td></tr><tr><td>Average Odds</td><td>Variance profile</td><td>Higher odds = higher variance and longer swings. Helps followers understand volatility.</td></tr><tr><td>Maximum Drawdown</td><td>Volatility</td><td>Shows the worst downturn. Essential to understand emotional and financial stress over time.</td></tr></tbody></table>
