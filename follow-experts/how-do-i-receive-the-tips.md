# How do I receive the tips?

When you follow an Expert, Bet2Invest sends you each new tip as a **notification**.

You can receive tips through two channels:

* **Telegram** (recommended)
* **Email**

Both channels carry the **same information** (event, market, odds, unit, etc.). The main differences are **speed** and **limits**.

***

### Notification channels

#### Telegram (recommended)

Telegram is the **best way** to receive tips:

* **Instant** delivery – tips usually arrive in your Telegram app as soon as the Expert posts them.
* Works on **mobile and desktop**.
* Easier to manage than a full inbox of emails.

On Telegram, Bet2Invest sends you a message with the key details of each tip so you can place the bet.

#### Email

If you prefer, you can also receive tips by **email**:

* Each new tip triggers an email with the same information as on the platform.
* Useful if you regularly check email but don’t want to install Telegram.

Email is slightly **slower and less convenient** than Telegram, especially if your mailbox is busy or filters are strict.

***

### Free vs Premium limits

Bet2Invest applies different limits depending on your plan and the type of expert you follow.

* **For PRO Experts**
  * **Unlimited email notifications**, even on the free plan.
  * **Unlimited Telegram notifications**, even on the free plan.
* **For other experts (non‑PRO)**
  * **Free users**
    * Up to **30 email notifications** in total.
    * Up to **70 Telegram notifications** in total.
  * **Premium users**
    * **Unlimited** email notifications.
    * **Unlimited** Telegram notifications.

{% hint style="info" %}
You always have **unlimited notifications for PRO Experts** you follow, even if you are not Premium. The free limits only apply to notifications coming from **non‑PRO experts**. Upgrading to Premium removes these limits and gives you unlimited notifications for **all** experts.
{% endhint %}
