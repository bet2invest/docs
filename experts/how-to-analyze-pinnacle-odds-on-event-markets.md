# How to Analyze Pinnacle Odds on Event Markets

On Bet2Invest, each event (match) comes with bookmaker-like market blocks (1X2, handicap, totals, props…) enriched with **Pinnacle odds history** and analysis layers.

This page explains how to read:

* **Odds evolution** (opening → closing)
* **Implied probabilities** over time
* **B2I tip distribution** on the selected market

### Analyze odds evolution (opening → closing)

For each selection, Bet2Invest shows a small **movement indicator** (the up/down evolution arrow).

#### What to do

1. Find the market you want (e.g., **1X2**, **Handicap**, **Total**).
2. Look at the **arrow** next to the odds:
   * an **up** move typically means the price increased (implied probability decreased)
   * a **down** move typically means the price decreased (implied probability increased)
3. **Hover** the arrow to open the odds evolution details.

Depending on the market, you can view the evolution in:

* a **table** (discrete snapshots), and/or
* a **chart** (visual timeline)

### View implied probabilities (and how they change)

Bet2Invest can show the **implied probabilities** behind Pinnacle odds.

To open the implied probability view, you need to click on the little "chart icon" on the odds evolution popup.

#### What to look for

* how much the probability moved from open → close
* whether movements are **smooth** or **sudden** (often linked to news or liquidity moments)
* whether multiple outcomes shift logically (e.g., if Team A probability rises, Team B typically drops)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Implied probabilities are derived from odds. They are not “true probabilities”, but they are a strong proxy for how the market is pricing the event.
{% endhint %}

### Compare with B2I tip distribution on the same market

For the market you are viewing, you can also see the **B2I tip distribution**: an aggregated view of what the Bet2Invest community is picking on that selection.

#### How to use it

* Identify whether the crowd is heavily concentrated on one side
* Compare crowd bias vs **line movement**
* Use it as an extra signal (never as a guarantee)

{% hint style="success" %}
The best insight comes from combining:

* sharp odds history (Pinnacle)
* implied probabilities
* and how tipsters are positioned

This helps you think in terms of **pricing** and **expected value**, not only “predictions”.

### Turn analysis into a measurable strategy

Market reading becomes much more valuable when you track your decisions.

* Place tips into a bankroll and evaluate them with **CLV/CLEV** over time.
* Learn how to judge long-term results with variance in mind.
