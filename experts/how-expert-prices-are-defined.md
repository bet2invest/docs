# How Expert Prices Are Defined

Expert pricing on Bet2Invest is designed to be **fair for followers** and **rewarding for PRO Experts**, while staying consistent with our data‑driven philosophy.

This page explains how prices are defined for:

* Individual expert subscriptions
* Picks by Package
* B2I One plans

If you want to understand how you are paid once a price is set, see [How PRO Experts Get Paid](how-pro-experts-get-paid.md).

***

### 1. Who Sets the Prices?

On Bet2Invest, **Bet2Invest defines the final prices** of public offers, sometimes in discussion with PRO Experts.

We do this to ensure that prices:

* Match the **real quality and scalability** of the strategy.
* Remain **coherent** across all experts and products.
* Offer **clear value** to followers, especially in bundled products like Packages and B2I One.

***

### 2. Main Criteria Used to Define Prices

Prices are not random. They are based on a combination of **objective metrics** and **practical constraints**.

#### a. Track Record & Rating

We primarily look at:

* **Sample size** (number of bets)
* **Yield / ROI** over a long period
* **CLV / CLEV** (ability to beat the market and the bookmaker margin)
* **Maximum drawdown and volatility**

These factors are summarised in our [Rating System](rating-system.md).\
In general, **higher and more stable ratings** justify **higher price tiers**.

#### b. Liquidity & Scalability

A strategy that operates mostly on **high‑liquidity markets** (top leagues, main lines) can realistically be followed by more users without killing the odds.

* High liquidity & scalable → can justify **higher or broader pricing**.
* Very low liquidity & fragile markets → may justify **more conservative pricing**, even with high ROI, because followers cannot always copy the odds.

See [Best practices](../bankrolls/best-practices.md) for more on liquidity.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Sometimes very low liquidity can lead to a high price to prevent the PRO Expert from gaining too many followers.
{% endhint %}

#### c. Variance & Risk Profile

Two experts with the same yield can have very different **risk profiles**:

* Lower odds, smoother equity curve, smaller drawdowns.
* Very high odds, big swings, large drawdowns.

More volatile strategies are often **harder to follow emotionally** and may be priced accordingly, especially in beginner‑oriented products.

#### d. Demand and Positioning

We also consider how an expert fits into the overall **Bet2Invest catalogue**:

* Is the strategy **unique** (niche markets, special modelling approach)?
* Is there already a similar expert at a similar price tier?
* How much **follower demand** is there for this type of strategy?

Prices aim to reflect not only performance but also **market positioning**.

***

### 3. Price Evolution Over Time

Prices are **not fixed forever**. They can evolve when:

* Your **performance improves or degrades** significantly.
* Your strategy becomes **more or less scalable** (liquidity, follower capacity).
* You are added to or removed from **B2I One plans**.

Any price change aims to keep a **fair balance** between:

* Rewarding PRO Experts for high‑quality, scalable strategies.
* Giving followers **good value and realistic expectations**.

If you are a PRO Expert and have questions or feedback about your pricing, you can contact Bet2Invest so we can review your situation in the context of these principles.
