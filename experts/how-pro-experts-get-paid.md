# How PRO Experts Get Paid

Bet2Invest allows **PRO Experts** to monetize their strategies in a transparent, rules‑based way. This page explains **how much** you earn and **how revenue is shared** across:

* Individual subscriptions
* Picks by Package
* B2I One (curated group of experts)

To understand how to become a PRO Expert in the first place, see [Become a PRO Expert](../getting-started/get-started/become-a-pro-expert.md) and [Requirements](pro-requirements.md).

***

### 1. Revenue Share Overview

When a user pays to access your tips (individually or through a group offer), the money is split between **you** and **Bet2Invest**.

* **67%** of the subscription price is reserved for **PRO Experts**.
* **33%** is kept by **Bet2Invest**.

This 67/33 split is applied consistently across:

* Individual expert subscriptions
* Picks by Package offers
* B2I One plans

The only difference between products is **how the expert share is split between experts**.

***

### 2. Individual Expert Subscriptions

An **individual subscription** is when a user pays specifically to follow **you**.

* The user chooses your profile and subscribes directly to your bankroll.
* For each paying subscriber, you receive **67% of the subscription price** associated with that product.

**Example**

* A user pays **€60** to follow you individually.
* The **expert share** is 67% of €60 / 1.2 (VAT) = **€33.50**.
* Since you are the only expert in this product, **you receive the full €33.50**.

Your revenue from individual subscriptions scales directly with:

* The **number of subscribers** you have.
* The **price level** of your individual plan.

***

### 3. Picks by Package

**Picks by Package** is an option where users are buying tips by group (example: buying 50 tips a time).

When a user buys a package:

1. The user pays the **package price**.
2. **67% of that price** is allocated to the Expert.
3. Only shared tips are counted. If a user purchased 50 tips and you only provided 25 tips in a month, you will be paid for half. The remaining balance will be paid the following month.

***

### 4. B2I One (Curated Group Subscription)

[B2I One](../follow-experts/easiest-way-to-follow-experts.md) is Bet2Invest’s flagship product for followers: an **all‑in‑one curated group of top experts** bundled with Premium features.

From an expert’s perspective, B2I One works similarly to Subscriptions:

1. Bet2Invest selects a **set of PRO Experts** for each B2I One plan (Beginner, Investor, Whale, etc.).
2. A user pays the **B2I One price** for their chosen plan.
3. **67% of that price** is allocated to the **experts included in that plan**.
4. That expert share is **split equally** between all included experts.

**Example**

* A B2I One _Investor_ plan costs **€120** per period and includes **3 PRO Experts**.
* 67% of €120 / 1.2 (VAT) = **€67** goes to experts.
* The split per expert is €67 / 3 = **€22.50** each.

The more B2I One subscribers there are, and the more plans you are included in, the more recurring revenue you receive from this channel.

***

### 5. Putting It All Together

As a PRO Expert, your total revenue can come from **several sources at the same time**:

* Direct followers via **individual subscriptions or picks packages**.
* Selection into **B2I One** plans.

All of these use the **same 67% expert share**, only the **splitting rules** change:

* **Individual subscription** → 67% goes to **you**.
* **Package / B2I One** → 67% is **shared equally** between all included experts.

This structure is designed so that:

* You are rewarded fairly when users choose to follow **you specifically**.
* You still benefit when Bet2Invest promotes you inside **bundled products** that attract broader audiences.
