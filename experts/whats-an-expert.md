# What's an expert?

On Bet2Invest, an **Expert** (also called a _tipster,_ _capper or handicapper_) is someone who shares a **structured, data‑driven betting strategy** through one or more public bankrolls so that others can follow it.

An Expert is **not** someone who just posts random bets or “locks of the day”. They are expected to think long term, manage variance, and treat betting like an investment process, not like gambling.

***

### What an Expert is on Bet2Invest

An Expert on Bet2Invest:

* **Runs at least one tracked bankroll**\
  All bets are recorded inside a [bankroll](../bankrolls/whats-a-bankroll.md), with transparent history, certified odds, dates, and results.
* **Uses units, not random stakes**\
  Stakes are expressed in **units**, not in money, following our [unit system](../bankrolls/whats-a-unit.md).\
  This avoids emotional over-staking and makes performance comparable across bankrolls.
* **Targets sharp markets with a real edge**\
  Experts try to beat efficient markets by finding small but consistent edges, often visible through **CLV/CLEV** and long‑term yield.
* **Thinks about market liquidity for followers**\
  In the best conditions, an Expert focuses on markets with **enough liquidity** so that followers can realistically obtain similar odds and stakes without excessively moving the lines.
* **Accepts variance and thinks in samples**\
  They understand that even with an edge, results can be negative for weeks or months.\
  Their decisions are based on probabilities and long‑term performance, not on the last few bets.
* **Lets the numbers speak**\
  Their performance is evaluated through objective metrics (yield, CLV/CLEV, sample size, drawdown, liquidity, etc.), summarized later by our [Rating System](rating-system.md).

Some Experts are additionally labeled as **Certified Experts (PROs)**, meaning they meet internal Bet2Invest quality and reliability criteria described in [Requirements](pro-requirements.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
On Bet2Invest, “Expert”, “tipster”, and “capper” refer to the same role.\
We use **Expert** as the default term in the product and documentation.
{% endhint %}

### What an Expert is **not**

To avoid unrealistic expectations, it is important to be clear about what an Expert is **not**:

* **Not a guarantee of profit**\
  Even the best Experts experience [variance](../bankrolls/whats-variance.md). Losing streaks and drawdowns are inevitable.
* **Not a financial advisor**\
  Experts share opinions and strategies about sports betting. They do **not** provide personalized financial advice.
* **Not above discipline**\
  Experts are expected to respect bankroll management and fixed‑unit staking just like followers. Chasing losses or manipulating stakes goes against the spirit of Bet2Invest.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If someone promises “guaranteed wins” or unrealistic returns, they are **not** acting as a Bet2Invest Expert, even if they call themselves a tipster elsewhere.
{% endhint %}

### How Experts operate on Bet2Invest

1. **They create and manage bankrolls**\
   Each strategy is tracked through a dedicated bankroll, which stores every pick with its odds, stake (in units), and result.
2. **They publish tips via the Bet2Invest interface**\
   Experts enter their picks directly on a Bet2Invest screen that is similar to bookmaker interfaces. Odds and markets are taken live from Pinnacle, **cannot be manually edited or faked**, and once a tip is confirmed it becomes immutable in the history. Results are automatically graded and filled by Bet2Invest based on official outcomes, following [Pinnacle betting rules](https://www.pinnacle.com/en/future/betting-rules).
3. **They publish picks in real time**\
   Followers receive notifications and can choose to replicate the bets in their own accounts, either manually or using **auto-betting** if it is activated on their side (see [What is Auto-betting?](../auto-betting/what-is-auto-betting.md)).
4. **Bet2Invest tracks performance objectively**\
   Metrics like yield, CLV/CLEV, liquidity (AMB), maximum drawdown, and sample size are updated over time and can be analysed in [How to Analyse Bankrolls?](../follow-experts/how-to-analyse-bankrolls.md).
5. **They are evaluated and rated**\
   Bet2Invest’s [Rating System](rating-system.md) combines all major metrics into a single, easier‑to‑read score.
6. **They may be included in curated offers**\
   The best and most scalable Experts can be selected into curated products like **B2I One**, so that users can follow a diversified group of Experts without having to choose each one manually.

### What you should expect from an Expert

When you follow an Expert on Bet2Invest, you should expect:

* **Transparency** – full, unedited history of picks and results.
* **Consistency** – clear rules, fixed units, and a stable approach over time.
* **Realistic variance** – swings up and down, including long losing streaks, are normal.
* **Long‑term focus** – performance judged over hundreds or thousands of bets, not a few days.

Your role as a follower is to:

* Set your own [bankroll](../bankrolls/whats-a-bankroll.md) and [unit size](../bankrolls/whats-a-unit.md).
* Respect your staking rules and avoid emotional changes.
* Understand that **variance is part of the journey**, even with strong Experts.

Handled correctly, Experts give you **access to professional‑level strategies** and tracking, while you stay in control of your risk and decisions.
